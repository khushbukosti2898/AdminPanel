Key Directories:
components: Contains reusable components like PageHeader, ChartComponent, and SummaryCard. These components are used across the app.
locales: Stores the translation files for i18next. These files handle multi-language support.
pages: Contains main page components like Dashboard.js.
services: Includes any mock APIs or data services used by the application.
Implemented Features
Dashboard Page
Page Header: Displays the page title dynamically.
Summary Cards: Displays statistical summaries like "New Users" with a dynamic value.
Charts:
Line Chart: Shows data over time (e.g., weekly stats).
Bar Chart: Provides visual insights into categorical data.
Pie Chart: Displays data breakdown for different traffic sources.
i18next Integration
Supports multiple languages, with language files located in the locales folder.
Languages can be easily added by updating the translation files in locales and using the useTranslation hook for dynamic content.
Running the Mock API
This project includes a mock API to simulate backend data retrieval. To run the mock API:

Install json-server: If you haven't installed json-server, you can install it globally:

bash
Copy code
npm install -g json-server
Create a mock database: Add a file named db.json to the project root:

json
Copy code
{
"users": [
{ "id": 1, "name": "John Doe", "age": 30 },
{ "id": 2, "name": "Jane Doe", "age": 25 }
]
}
Run the mock API: In a new terminal window, run:

bash
Copy code
json-server --watch db.json --port 5000
The mock API will be available at http://localhost:5000.

Integrate with the frontend:

In the frontend code, change the API endpoints to point to the mock API (e.g., http://localhost:5000/users).
Design Choices

1. Component-Driven Architecture
   The app is designed around reusable React components like PageHeader, SummaryCard, and ChartComponent. This modular approach ensures scalability and maintainability as more features are added.
2. i18next for Localization
   i18next was chosen for its flexibility and ease of integration into React applications. The project can easily support additional languages by adding translation files.
3. Material-UI for Styling
   The application uses Material-UI components (Grid, Stack, etc.) to ensure consistent, responsive layouts and user-friendly design.
4. ECharts for Charting
   ECharts was selected due to its performance and ability to handle various chart types (line, bar, pie, etc.). The echarts-for-react library is used for React integration.
   Other Notes
   Error Handling
   Basic error handling is in place for data fetching operations (e.g., from mock APIs). More robust error handling can be added as the app scales.
   Future Enhancements
   State Management: Currently, the app doesn't use a global state management tool like Redux. As the app grows, state management might be introduced to manage more complex interactions.
   Unit Testing: Jest and React Testing Library can be added for component unit testing.
